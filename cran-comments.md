## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have fulfilled the violated CRAN policy "Packages which use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an informative message
if the resource is not available or has changed (and not give a check warning nor error)". Originally, `ewsnet_reset` warned. I have now:

- converted warnings to messages.
