}
\usage{
multiJI(data, winsize = 50, theta_seq = NULL, scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric matrix with time in first column and species abundances in other columns}

\item{winsize}{Numeric. Defines the window size of the rolling window as a percentage of the time series length.}

\item{theta_seq}{Numeric vector of thetas (nonlinear tuning parameters) to estimate the Jacobian over. If `NULL`, a default sequence covering `0:8` is provided.}

\item{scale}{Boolean. Should data be scaled within each window prior to estimating the Jacobian.}
}
\value{
A dataframe where the first column is last time index of the window and the second column is the estimated index value. A value <1.0 indicates stability, a value >1.0 indicates instability.
}
\description{
Calculate a stability metric from the s-map estimated Jacobian
}
\examples{
#Load the multivariate simulated
#dataset `simTransComms`

data(simTransComms)

#Subset the third community prior to the transition

pre_simTransComms <- subset(simTransComms$community3,time < inflection_pt)

#Estimate the stability index for the third community
#(trimmed for speed)

egJI <- multiJI(data = pre_simTransComms[1:10,2:5],
winsize = 75)
