# About this tutorial

This tutorial introduces how to interface with **EWSNet**, a machine learning model trained to predict critical transitions, tipping points, and regime shifts (Deb *et al.* 2022). We will only focus on how to set up your R session to interact with EWSNet and how to interpret the output rather than the theory and mathematics underlying the model. If you are interest in those details, please refer to the EWSNet specific [website and documentation](https://ewsnet.github.io) or the associated [publication](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.211475).

__NOTE__ This version of EWSNet differs from that published by Deb *et al.* (2022) in that is has been retrained using a range of time series lengths (minimum = 15). This immproves the accuracy of EWSNet over a range of time series lengths but we recommend that the minimum length to be tested should be 15 data points.

<br>  

# Getting started

```{r, message=FALSE}
set.seed(123) #to ensure reproducible data

library(EWSmethods)
```

As EWSNet has been written and developed in Python, for R to interact with it, we need to exploit the `reticulate` [R package](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/). `reticulate` provides the tools to run Python code in R and transfer objects between the two languages but tends to run much smoother in RStudio rather than base R. It is therefore recommended that you use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) when using the EWSNet portion of `EWSmethods`.

The following sections will show how to setup and run EWSNet in `EWSmethods` before troubleshooting a few common errors stemming from the Python-`reticulate`-R interface.

<br>  

## 1. Initialising **EWSNet**

Rather than requiring the user to learn `reticulate` and setup the R session themselves, `EWSmethods` provides a single function capable of checking your machine for Python, installing it if it's not found (along with the critical packages), creating a new Python environment to hold these packages, and then activating that environment when ready. To prevent the user accidentally installing Python or packages, the function does require confirmation inputs from the user and so needs to be run **at the start of any new R session**.

For example, to create a new Python environment called `"EWSNET_env"` and install Python, the function would be written as below. The environment name (`"EWSNET_env"`) will be critical to running the later functions.

```{r ewsnet_init, warning = FALSE,eval=F}
#prepares your session using 'reticulate' and asks to install Anaconda (if no appropriate Python found) and/or a Python environment before activating that environment with the necessary Python packages
ewsnet_init(envname = "EWSNET_env", pip_ignore_installed = FALSE,  conda_refresh = FALSE)
```

```{r ewsnet_init_true, echo=FALSE,warning = FALSE,message=FALSE}
bypass_reticulate_autoinit()

#set auto = T so no user input required
ewsnet_init(envname = "EWSNET_env", pip_ignore_installed = FALSE,  conda_refresh = FALSE, auto = T)

ewsnet_reset(remove_weights = FALSE,auto = T)

#reticulate::use_condaenv("EWSNET_env") #redundant step necessary for RMarkdown
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

If successful, you will have had to input `"y"` to allow `EWSmethods` to download and activate the Python environment and now see the message `"EWSNET_env successfully found and activated. Necessary Python packages installed"`). If not, please refer to the Troubleshooting section at the end of the tutorial.

To double check the environment activation, you could use `reticulate` functions to check first what environment is active and second what Python packages have been loaded:

```{r reticulate}
library(reticulate)

#print which Python environment `EWSmethods` is using
reticulate::py_config()

#list all packages currently loaded in to "EWSNET_env"
py_packages <- reticulate::py_list_packages() 
head(py_packages)
```

`EWSmethods` also does not come bundled with the necessary model weights to make predictions. This is due the size of the weight files being ~220 MB which is not appropriate for all users of the package. To download these weights, we can use the `ewsnet_reset()` function which can either remove no-longer-needed weights or re/download from [https://ewsnet.github.io](https://ewsnet.github.io).

```{r ewsnet_reset,warning = FALSE,eval=F}
ewsnet_reset(remove_weights = FALSE)
```

```{r ewsnet_reset_true, echo=FALSE,warning = FALSE,message=FALSE}
ewsnet_reset(remove_weights = FALSE, auto = T)
```

If successful, you will have had to input `"y"` to allow `EWSmethods` to download the pretrained weights.

<br>  

## 2. Predictions from **EWSNet**
 
To give an example on how to use `ewsnet_predict()` we need some test data. Here, we will use some random noise around a mean of 0 which we expect to be predicted as `"No Transition"`.

```{r create_white_data, warning = FALSE,dpi=144}
test_data <- rnorm(50,mean = 0, sd=2)

plot(test_data)
```

We then simply provide this vector to `ewsnet_predict()` while also specifying the Python environment, the scaling of the data and ensemble number (how many models to average the prediction over).

```{r ewsnet_predict, warning = FALSE}
ewsnet_prediction <- ewsnet_predict(test_data, scaling = TRUE, ensemble = 25, envname = "EWSNET_env") 

ewsnet_prediction
```

### Interpreting EWSNet
As with any machine learning model, interpreting prediction probabilities is difficult. In EWSNet's case, as three possible predictions can be made - _No transition, Smooth transition, Critical transition_ - a chance prediction is one that is approximately 0.33 (1.0 divided by 3 is ~0.33). 

Therefore any probability greater than 0.33 implies a stronger than chance prediction and anything greater than 0.6 warrants serious scrutiny. 

Similarly, the real world manifestation of a Smooth or Critical transition is unclear (Kefi *et al* 2013, Gsell *et al* 2016). EWSNet therefore considers a `"Smooth Transition"` prediction to indicate a directional trend in the system whereas a `"Critical Transition"` indicates a rapid non-linear change. A `"No Transition"` prediction consequently suggests a stable period.

The below figure visually depicts the models that have been used to train these predictions and how those predictions relate to time series data.

```{r figure, echo=F,fig.cap = "Conceptual diagram of A) the type of transitions that EWSNet has been trained on and B) how those transitons can appear in real time series data"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure_3.png", dpi = 144)
```

<br>  

### Predictions through time
An additional way to use EWSNet is to explore how predictions change through time. By iteratively adding in new data, we can see how those predictions evolve.

For example, using our test data, we could use this code to identify transitions that may have happened in the past:

```{r expanding_ewsnet, warning = FALSE,dpi=144}

#define the range of indexes to test over
expanding_range <- 20:length(test_data) 

#pre-define our out file
expanding_ewsnet <- data.frame(expanding_range, matrix(NA,ncol=3 )) |>
  `colnames<-`(c("cutoff_ind","No transition",'Smooth','Critical')) 

#call `ewsnet_predict()` for each index 
for(i in seq_along(expanding_range)){ 
  ews.tmp <- ewsnet_predict(test_data[1:expanding_range[i]],scaling = TRUE, ensemble = 25, envname = "EWSNET_env") 
  
  expanding_ewsnet[i,] <- c(expanding_range[i],ews.tmp$no_trans_prob,ews.tmp$smooth_trans_prob,ews.tmp$critical_trans_prob)
}

#plot the results
ggplot(expanding_ewsnet |> pivot_longer(-cutoff_ind,names_to = "Prediction",values_to = "prob"),
                aes(x=cutoff_ind,y=prob)) +
    geom_point(aes(col=Prediction)) + theme_bw() +
    xlab("Assessment index") + ylab("Prediction probability")
```

Here we see how prediction probabilities fluctuate with new data, with the trends in probabilities also providing information on how the system has changed over time.

<br>  

## 3. Finetuning EWSNet

__Development in progress__

<br>  

## 4. Resetting EWSNet

Following finetuning, it may be desirable to reset the model weights to their default. Using the `ewsnet_reset()` function, the user can direct `EWSmethods` to the path of the default weights (these can be redownloaded from the [EWSNet github ](https://github.com/sahilsid/ewsnet)) which will overwrite the current model weights stored by `EWSmethods`.

```{r ewsnet_reset2, eval= FALSE}
ewsnet_reset(remove_weights = FALSE) 
```

You may want to remove Python downloads and environment setup by `EWSmethods` and/or any downloaded EWSNet weights. You can achieve this using `ewsnet_init()` and the `conda_refresh =` argument, and `ewsnet_reset()` respectively.

```{r ewsnet_refresh, eval= FALSE}
ewsnet_init(envname = "EWSNET_env",conda_refresh = TRUE) # removes Python, its packages and the "EWSNET_env" environment
```

```{r ewsnet_refresh2, eval= FALSE}
ewsnet_reset(remove_weights = TRUE) # removes any downloaded EWSNet weights
```

# Troubleshooting

## 1. _`reticulate` is activating a different environment to the one I gave to `ewsnet_init()`_

This is the main error when using `EWSmethods`. The first solution is to simply restart the R session and rerun `ewsnet_init()`. If `reticulate` is loaded before `ewsnet_init()` is run, then the default `reticulate` environment `"r-reticulate"` is activated instead of your EWSNet environment. Therefore ensure no `reticulate` command or `library(reticulate)` is run prior to 
`ewsnet_init()`.

If the error remains and your RStudio version is >=1.4, you may need to edit your Python interpreter settings in RStudio's preferences. Go to Preferences -> Python and untick "Automatically activate project-level Python environments". Then restart your R session and rerun `ewsnet_init()`.

The final solution we are aware of involves deactivating `reticulate`'s default behaviour in your global R environment settings. Running `bypass_reticulate_autoinit()` will disable `reticulate`'s ability to load a Python environment without a user request. Restart your R session and rerun `ewsnet_init()` once ready.

<br>  

## 2. _`ewsnet_predict()` is returning Python errors_

These errors are extremely difficult to debug through R . Fortunately, in our experience, such errors are legacies of previous issues such as incorrect initialising of the Python environment, the crashing of an R session, or killing of the running function. The error is therefore often solved by restarting the R session and rerunning `ewsnet_init()`.

If the error remains, please submit a bug report [here](https://github.com/duncanobrien/EWSmethods/issues).

<br>  

## 3. _I want to uninstall Python and its environments_

`ewsnet_init()` provides the capabaility to do this using the `conda_refresh =` argument: 

`ewsnet_init(envname = "envname",conda_refresh = TRUE)`.

This function will remove any downloaded Python versions, packages or environments to allow a fresh install or permanent removal.
